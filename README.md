CCminer for NeoScrypt
=======

All other algorithms have been removed from this distribution. Oh well.

Also fixed enough of this trouble to get compiled with Visual Studio 2010
(or vs2010 target in newer Visual Studio distributions) for Windows XP and up
the way, 32-bit and 64-bit.

Doesn't depend on OpenSSL and Zlib any more. Curl updated to v7.47.1.

Compiled and tested on the NVIDIA Maxwell architecture GPUs only.
